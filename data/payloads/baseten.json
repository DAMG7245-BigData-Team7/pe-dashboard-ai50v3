While company has solid funding and runway, operational execution issues and team instability raise serious concerns about ability to scale and compete in crowded ML infrastructure market.",
  "risks": [
    "Recent 22% workforce reduction (25 employees) only 3 months after $100M Series B raise - suggests burn rate concerns",

    "Public controversy over GPU availability and pricing transparency - customer trust issues",
    "Negative headcount growth (-22% YoY) indicating organizational contraction despite recent funding",
    "Slowing revenue growth (180% → 60% YoY) suggests product-market fit challenges",
    "Moderate Glassdoor rating (3.4/5) with recent reviews mentioning 'layoffs' and 'uncertainty'",
