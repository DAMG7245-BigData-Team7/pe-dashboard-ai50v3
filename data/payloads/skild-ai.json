    "description": "Most AI today exists solely in cyberspace. Physical reality is far more information rich, and automating physical tasks offers immense returns. We are building AI that will interact with and affect change in the real world. Our thesis is that physical AI should be omni-bodied and should not be limited by robot or task type. We are building a unified, omni-bodied brain to control any robot for any task.",
